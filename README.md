# course-automatic-control-experiment-duckiebot

Automatic Control Student Material for the Duckiebot Experiments

Write everything in this repository in English: reports, code, comments, file names, and commit messages.

## Experiment 2 in brief

You measure how the wheel of a Duckiebot DB17 responds to steps of the motor's PWM duty cycle, and show where the linear first-order model of the course fails: dead zone, duty-dependent gain and time constant, and hysteresis.
The Raspberry Pi of the robot drives the motor and logs every command, while a phone films the spinning wheel with a sync LED in view.
The code in `scripts/` turns each video and the Pi log into wheel angle, speed, and input, and draws the figures of the case study.

- 8 Duckiebots, R1 to R8, so 8 groups, one robot per group.
- Each group hands in one report, written together.
- The software on the Duckiebot is already on its SD card;
  this repository holds only the code that runs on your computer.

## Hand-in: two pull requests

You hand in by opening two pull requests to this repository, <https://github.com/nordlinglab/course-automatic-control-experiment-duckiebot>:

1. **Data pull request**, first.
   It adds your group's motor folders in `data/raw/`, organised and named as described under [Data](#data), and nothing else.
   A teaching assistant reviews it;
   fix what the review asks for and push again until the teaching assistant approves it.
2. **Report pull request**, after the data pull request is approved.
   It adds the LaTeX source of your group report in `doc/report_FamilynameYEAR_TwoTitleWords_Group<NN>/`, and any change you made to `scripts/`.
   **Deadline: 2026-11-26.**

Commit the LaTeX source, the bibliography, and the figures, never the compiled PDF.

## Files provided

The steps are those of [From video to figures](#from-video-to-figures).

| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | These instructions. |
| `data/schema.md` | Every stored variable, its format, and how each derived quantity and its uncertainty is computed; the scripts cite its sections as §. |
| `doc/template_Nordling2026_LatexExample/` | Example report: copy it to start your group report. |
| `doc/lecture_Nordling2026_Exp2/` | Slides of the Experiment 2 lecture. |
| `scripts/requirements.txt` | Python packages the scripts need. |
| `scripts/track_video.py` | Step 2: tracks the marker, hub, and sync LED in one video and writes its frame table `frames/<run>.parquet`; prints the row for `runs.csv`. |
| `scripts/process_raw.py` | Step 3: synchronises the Pi command log with the video through the LED and computes wheel angle, speed, acceleration, and input, with uncertainty, into `data/processed/`. |
| `scripts/quality_report.py` | Step 3: writes `quality.md` in the motor folders you name, with the checks, warnings, and recommendations. |
| `scripts/select_wheel_frames.py` | Step 5, optional: picks the video frames shown in the wheel-overlay figure of the article's supplement. |
| `scripts/plot_case_study_csme2026.py` | Step 4: fits the models and draws the case-study figures (small duty, step to 0.6, step to 1.0, hysteresis, rest noise, methods, wheel overlay) and writes their numbers as LaTeX macros in `results.tex`. |
| `scripts/duckiebot_analysis/` | The library the scripts import: `tracking/` (video and blob tracking), `data/` (file formats and Pi logs), `analysis/` (angle, sync, processing, quality, case study), `models/`, and `visualization/` (figures). |
| `scripts/tests/test_student_kit.py` | Tests of the trial names, folder names, LED colour, and motor selection. |

## Using the code

### Install once

You need Python 3.12 or newer, which NumPy and SciPy require, and FFmpeg (`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on the PATH).
From the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

On Windows in Git Bash, activate with `source .venv/Scripts/activate`.
Activate again in every new terminal, and check the installation with `pytest scripts/tests`.

### From video to figures

Run every command from the repository root.
The example is robot R5, left wheel, motor m9;
replace the names with yours.

1. Create the motor folder and copy the Pi logs into it unchanged, as described under [Data](#data).
2. Track each video:

   ```bash
   python scripts/track_video.py <video-folder>/<run>.mp4 \
       --folder data/raw/db17-r5-left-m9 --mode stand \
       --camera "phone slow motion 1280x720 240 fps" \
       --experiment <label> --sync log+led \
       --pi-log "pi/<trial1>_events.csv;pi/<trial2>_events.csv" \
       --trials "<trial1>;<trial2>" \
       >> data/raw/db17-r5-left-m9/runs.csv
   ```

   The defaults are the kit's blue marker tape and green sync LED.
   Check the first line it prints, `<n> frames, marker absent in <m>`;
   if `m` is large, give a wider colour rule with `--marker-colour`, and use the same rule for every clip.
   To track a video again, first delete its row from `runs.csv`, then rerun the command with `--force`, which replaces the frame table;
   `runs.csv` must list each run once.
3. Process the motor folder and check its quality:

   ```bash
   python scripts/process_raw.py data/raw/db17-r5-left-m9
   python scripts/quality_report.py --raw data/raw --processed data/processed \
       db17-r5-left-m9
   ```

   Name only your own motor folders, so that the report leaves other groups' `quality.md` unchanged.
   Read `data/raw/db17-r5-left-m9/quality.md`.
   A warning means the data should not be used for the quantities it affects:
   use a clean trial of the same condition, or record the clip again.
   Every trial should report `log+led`, which shows the LED was read.
4. Draw the figures and compute the numbers:

   ```bash
   python scripts/plot_case_study_csme2026.py --data data \
       --folder db17-r5-left-m9 --label R5-L-m9 \
       --figures build/figures/db17-r5-left-m9
   ```

   It needs one run of the dense sweep (E1, run name `R5-L-m9_A_sweep_dense_...`) and one run of the steps 0 → 0.6 → 1.0 → 0.6 → 0 (E2, run name `R5-L-m9_C_b060p040...`), and stops if it finds more than one.
   Copy the figures your report uses into its `figures/` folder.
5. Optional, for the wheel-overlay figure, run before step 4:

   ```bash
   python scripts/select_wheel_frames.py <video-folder>/<run>.mp4 --turns ccw
   ```

   with `--turns` set to `positive_duty_turns` of the motor's `setup.toml`.

## Data

The data is organised exactly as in the dataset of the article.

### What to commit

Commit only measured data, small enough for git:

- the frame table of each video, `frames/<run>.parquet` (about 1 MB each);
- the Pi logs, unchanged;
- `runs.csv`, `trials.csv`, `setup.toml`, and `quality.md`;
- hand measurements in `manual/`.

Never commit:

- videos (1 to 2.4 GB each): keep them outside the repository and back them up;
  `runs.csv` names each by its SHA-256 checksum;
- `data/processed/` and `data/interim/`, which the scripts regenerate from `data/raw/`;
- `build/`, compiled PDFs, `.venv/`, and caches.

`.gitignore` already excludes all of these.
Add files by name, such as `git add data/raw/db17-r5-left-m9/runs.csv`, never with `git add .`.

### Folders

```text
data/
├── schema.md                     variables, formats, and derivations
├── raw/                          measured data, committed, never edited
│   └── db17-<robot>-<position>-<motor>/   one folder per motor

└── interim/                      scratch files, not committed
```

### Folder names

A motor folder is named `db17-<robot>-<position>-<motor>`, all in lower case:

- `<robot>` is the robot the motor was mounted on, `r1` to `r8`.
- `<position>` is `left` or `right`, the wheel the motor drives, as seen from behind the robot driving forward.
- `<motor>` is the motor's number, `m1` to `m16`, written on the motor.
- A run that drives both wheels goes in `db17-<robot>-both-<left motor>-<right motor>`.

For example, `db17-r5-left-m9` and `db17-r5-both-m9-m10`.
The Pi writes its logs under the label `R5-L-m9`;
copy them unchanged into `data/raw/db17-r5-left-m9/pi/`, together with `motor_mapping.json`, and check that the SHA-256 checksums of both copies match.

### File names

- A run is one video.
  Its name is the video's file name without extension, starting with the Pi label, such as `R5-L-m9_C_b060p040_rep01-03_20261112`.
  Rename the video to its clip name before tracking it, and never rename it afterwards.
- A trial is one command sequence sent by the Pi, named by the Pi, such as `R5-L-m9_C_b060p040_rep01_20261112_142210`.
  A run holds one or more trials.
- Keep the file names the Pi gave its logs.

### Describe the setup

`setup.toml` holds the constants of the setup, for example:

```toml
robot = "r5"
motor = "left"
motor_label = "m9"
hat = "Adafruit DC & Stepper Motor HAT, PCA9685 at 0x60"
hat_channel = "M1"
pwm_frequency_hz = 1600
quantisation = "pca9685"
supply = "5.1 V mains adapter, powering both the Pi and the motor HAT"
positive_duty_turns = "cw"
marker = "blue tape on the yellow wheel, from the hub to the rim"
sync_led = "green LED on GPIO21, switched just before every motor command"
```

`positive_duty_turns` is `cw` or `ccw`, the direction a positive duty turns the wheel as the camera sees it.
Start `runs.csv` and `trials.csv` with these header lines:

```text
run,video_file,video_sha256,video_bytes,duration_s,resolution,fps_nominal,mode,experiment,sync,pi_log,trials,notes
```

```text
trial,run,script,script_commit,args,start_pi,duration_s,changes,status,notes
```

`track_video.py` prints the `runs.csv` rows;
write one `trials.csv` row per trial from its `_meta.json`.
`data/schema.md` defines every column.

## Your group report

Place the report in its own folder in `doc/`, named

```text
doc/report_FamilynameYEAR_TwoTitleWords_Group<NN>/
```

- `Familyname` is the family name of the first author, in ASCII letters.
- `YEAR` is the four-digit year of the report.
- `TwoTitleWords` is two words from the report title, each starting with a capital letter.
- `<NN>` is your two-digit group number.

For example, `doc/report_Andersson2026_WheelDynamics_Group03/`:

```text
doc/report_Andersson2026_WheelDynamics_Group03/
├── main.tex
├── references.bib
└── figures/
    └── fig-step-06.pdf
```

List every group member as an author, with their student ID, in order of falling contribution, and describe each member's contribution in the Contributions section with the CRediT roles, as the example report shows.

## Writing the report

We recommend LaTeX with the standard `article` class and APA references through `biblatex-apa`.
The report must compile with `pdflatex`, or with LuaLaTeX when it contains Chinese text, as Appendix B of the example report explains.

Start from the example report in `doc/template_Nordling2026_LatexExample/`: copy the folder to your report folder and replace its text.
The example has the structure of a technical report, and its text explains how to write each section and how to format figures, tables, equations, units, citations, and code.
Its minimal skeleton is:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{csquotes}
\usepackage[backend=biber,style=apa,annotation=false]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{references.bib}

\title{Nonlinear Dynamics of a Duckiebot Wheel Motor}
\author{Ann Andersson \and Bo-Wei Chen \and Carlos Garcia}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
...
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/fig-step-06.pdf}
  \caption{...}
\end{figure}
...
\section*{Contributions}
...
\printbibliography
\end{document}
```

Compile it into `build/` from the repository root, which runs `pdflatex` and `biber` as often as needed:

```bash
latexmk -pdf -cd \
  -outdir=../../build/report_Andersson2026_WheelDynamics_Group03 \
  doc/report_Andersson2026_WheelDynamics_Group03/main.tex
```

## Git for the group

One group member forks this repository on GitHub and adds the other members as collaborators on the fork.
Each member then works on their own computer:

```bash
git clone <URL of your group's fork>
cd course-automatic-control-experiment-duckiebot
git remote add upstream \
  https://github.com/nordlinglab/course-automatic-control-experiment-duckiebot.git
```

For the data pull request:

```bash
git switch -c group03-data
git add data/raw/db17-r5-left-m9/runs.csv data/raw/db17-r5-left-m9/setup.toml
git commit -m "Add data of robot R5, left wheel, motor m9"
git push -u origin group03-data
```

Add the frame tables and Pi logs the same way, by name, then open the pull request on GitHub from `group03-data` to `main` of this repository.
After the teaching assistant approves it, start the report from the updated repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git switch -c group03-report upstream/main
git add doc/report_Andersson2026_WheelDynamics_Group03/main.tex
git commit -m "Add the group report"
git push -u origin group03-report
```

Before you start work each time, run `git pull` to get your group members' commits, and run `git status` to see what you are about to commit.
